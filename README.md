 # Some help docs for this kit

#### So basically this thing is for fast setup and a powerful terminal. Really useful for servers / when changing operating systems n shit.
#### If you want to add your own command and still use the help option, just put a '# something something' below your 'alias' or function declaration, examples are in .bashrc ofc.
